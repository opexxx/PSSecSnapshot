# PSSecSnapshot
Based on Jason Fossen's snapshot.bat script.
Public domain, probably broken, don't be an asshole.

Both versions of the script will use a mix of methods to gather a massive list of config data on a target machine and dump it to a UNC file path - defined in the script itself - DONT FORGET TO EDIT THIS!

Read comments at beginning of script for usage.
